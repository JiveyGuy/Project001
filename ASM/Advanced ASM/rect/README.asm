A single-player Pong game. A ball bounces off the screen's "walls". The player attempts to hit the ball with a paddle by pressing the left and right arrow keyboard keys. For each successful hit, the player gains one point and the paddle shrinks a little, to make the game slightly more challenging. If the player misses the ball, the game is over. To quit the game, press the ESC key.
