**The hardware projects can be built on any personal computer using a simple Hardware Description Language (HDL), described in the book, and a supplied Hardware Simulator.**

The software projects (assembler, virtual machine, and compiler for a simple object-based language) can be developed in any programming language, using the project materials available in this site. A mini-OS is also built, using the high-level language designed in the course.
